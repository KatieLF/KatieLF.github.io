This is an independant project that I did all the leg work for but not the actual coding. So today is the day to change that!
The codebook is on [github](https://github.com/KatieLF/NPHA-intergen) so I will only be talking about the methodologies that I used.
The data is from he National Poll on Healthy Aging conducted in January 2021. Some of my many reasearch includes intergenerational relationships, focusing on grandparental figures, and the mental health of both the grandparent and the grandchild. While this is only a survey of those of a grandparent age, there are questions such as types of relationships, if children are living in the household with them, and the participants mental health.
Since it is difficult to find proper studies on some of my favorite topics, I thought I would do a secondary analysis on the freely available data to shed some light on this numerical relationships.
While I learned a bit of R in my undergrad years, honestly I've forgotten most of it. Therefore I'll be using python as my primary coding language for this project.

I started out by cleaning the data.
