This is a project that I worked on in an undergrad on "Digital Media" at Bethel University. It was held in spring of 2020 so suddenly I had an abundance of extra time for this final project. As a result, I combined my love of creating food and documented it with my website with a little storytelling flair. I curated, created, and catalogued every recipe you see on the website, photographed and edited each image, as well as made all of the HTML and CSS from scratch.

I'm currently figuring out how to make it available on the internet via GitHub without wrecking this website so it currently lives on a repository on GitHub under "Fantasy_Foods"
