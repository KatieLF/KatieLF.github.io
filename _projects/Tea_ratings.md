I didn't start out as a tea lover, it snuck up on me with a almond, coconut, and chocoate exterier. It was dependable when I needed caffine in university and didn't have the migraine drawbacks of coffee. As I age and gain experience, the fact that all tea is NOT created equal has made itself quite appearent.
So, I'm trying out this page as a living list of tea's I've tried, their perks and downsides [inspried by Gwern](https://gwern.net/review/tea).

### The standards

###### Yorkshire Red: 4/5

Mostly for the nostalgia but still a solid choice. Is easily overbrewed and has lots of tannins due to it's powdery nature

###### Liptin 1/5

Strong in the tannins but not in the flavor. Bitter and not in a good way.The only way I can stand it is when it is iced tea.

### Tea Source

My favorite place to get loose leaf in the twin cities. Minnesota based but sources tea from all around the world with their strong relationships.

###### Witch's Brew 4.8/5

My favorite blend from them at the moment. I never thought I would like a hoppy flavor in my tea (partically because I don't drink) but it is amazing.

###### Summer Cabin 3.8/5

Light for a black tea, nothing to really write home about. I'm learning I like a little bit of tannins in my tea but this has almost none at all.

### To Try

- hojicha: I tried some in Japan and wasn't initially a fan. I want to try more varieties to make sure.
