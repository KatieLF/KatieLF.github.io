- UCLA's ["What statistical analysis should I use?"](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/spss/whatstat/what-statistical-analysis-should-i-usestatistical-analyses-using-spss/#:~:text=A%20one%2Dway%20analysis%20of,levels%20of%20the%20independent%20variable). It's technically for SPSS but they give excellent descriptions for each type of statistical test.
  I would like to eventually make a giant table with all of this but that is a project for a rainy day.
  JK, they already did [here](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/)
