Greeting's ya'll (you all),

I'm Katie L. Friese, an aspiring academic, a auspicious organizer, and a creative/making enthusiast. Since I'm a continual learner I thought I should have a place to document it all. So this is the place on the internet where I put my musings, experiments, and undertakings.

- The <u>projects</u> tab is where each thing I've worked on is collected all in one place. This is everything from data driven visualization projects to a particular recipe I've perfected in my spare time. Everything is tagged appropriately and there is a search bar in the top right to help you (or me) find exactly what you're looking for.
- The <u>blog</u> tab is my weekly musings of what I've learned or what I'm currently scheming on. It gets updated weekly (or whenever inspiration strikes me).
- <u>CV</u> is everything I've ever done professionally. I'm currently looking for an administration or data position in the Twin Cities area. If you sought me out and are interested in hearing more about my particular skill set, contact me <u>here</u>.
